# Snipyt

Keep your projects on track and teams organized using Snipyt. Easily and efficiently track the status of your teams, and collaborate with others from anywhere in real-time using this web-based app. 

At the core of Snipyt is the "snippet", a brief status report that everyone in an organization shares with their manager on a weekly basis to summarize what they have been working on. 

## Main features

1. Edit snippets and collaborate with other users in real-time (thanks to Firebase)
2. Search for snippets and users (uses Elasticsearch)
3. Create various visualizations of your organization and snippets (built with D3.js)
4. Send an e-mail to the author of a snippet by double-clicking on a snippet
5. Change user privileges and edit their profile information as an admin
6. Access any snippet from previous weeks by toggling the week in the dashboard view
